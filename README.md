License
--------------
The license is Apache 2.0. See LICENSE.

Releases
-------------
Published releases are available on Maven Central.

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>edu.jhuapl.dorset</groupId>
  <artifactId>dorset-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Versioning
-------------
We follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). Each version number has 3 parts (for example, 1.2.1) with the components being
 * Major: backward compatible breaking changes
 * Minor: new functionality, but backward compatible
 * Bug Fixes: no new functionality

We expect the API to not be stable until version 0.5.0 so expect compatibility breaking changes until that release.
